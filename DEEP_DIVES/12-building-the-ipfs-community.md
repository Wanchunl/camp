## Summary

## Problems we identified and porposed solutions:
 Problem | Solution
  --------|----------
Wide potential audience to tap into, but need a place to start: diverse *Motivations* (personal, professional, ect.) and *Demographics* (mostly developers/enginneers, but also pirvacy and/or self sov. advocates/activists, ect.) | Tool(s) to help a new person identify the best place to start (not the same for everyone) based on: What you already know about PL product(s) and tech that powers it; Why you are interested/care; what you want to do/contribute
A need to have the community grow organically/virally w/o direct support | templates, tools, and *resuable content* to help organizers succeed and recruit&teach other organizers. Incentives to make those things and improve them.
Attract and better support more pople | Incentives to join with other communities and increase diversity in your own.
Overhead organising is huge: time, effort, resources | More broadly advertising general weekly call end editing down to highlights specifically for reuse at live events. 
Fresh reccuring content is missing | Exposing more highlights from the whole ecosystem in a newsletter-like way by core PL team + organizers, for organizers to consume. Suggested meetup formats around this info. 
Methods to onboard new OSS contibutors to PL | Build **framework** starter kits w/ *plugable componants* for dApps, ex: truffle and incentivise improvement of kits and new/improved components as your first contributions. 
More places to get started w/o any experience | Also solves needing more, and continious improvment on, existing dweb funcionality/tools.

Growth in diversity of community| MLM style incentives for giving talks/worksops that reqruit more organizers && promote inclusivitty / diversity in meetups ( in widest possible demographics. Bunus for uniqueness of new membership that comes from there.  
Cultural differences har to bridge. | identify and supporrt ambasadors for a culture/region/lanuge. Regular core team status /checkins to get pulse of each ambasador's region.
